1. Introduction
Air travel reviews are invaluable for airlines. They provide insights into passengers' experiences, from booking a ticket to disembarking at their destination. This project seeks to quantify these experiences by focusing on several aspects:

Overall sentiment
Routes with the highest and lowest scores
Rating across various service categories
Key complaints from negative reviews
2. Data Collection
Using web scraping techniques, we collect reviews from www.airlinequality.com. Each review provides:

Reviewer name
Review date
Overall score
Review content
Type of traveller
Seat type
Route
Date flown
Ratings in categories such as:
Seat Comfort
Cabin Staff Service
Food & Beverages
Inflight Entertainment
Ground Service
Value For Money
3. Data Analysis
3.1 Sentiment Analysis
Insert the sentiment distribution pie chart here.

Using the TextBlob library, each review's sentiment is gauged. This categorizes reviews as:

Positive
Neutral
Negative
This pie chart showcases the distribution of these sentiments.

3.2 Bayesian Weighted Average
Insert the bar charts for Routes with Best and Worst Reviews here.

Routes are rated based on a Bayesian weighted average to provide a more balanced view. The idea is to consider both the average score of a route and the number of reviews it has.

3.3 Review Categories Analysis
Insert the bar chart for Average Ratings for Review Categories here.

Each review contains ratings for different service categories. This bar chart illustrates the average ratings for each category, offering a broad overview of British Airways' performance in specific areas.

3.4 Key Complaint Areas
Insert the bar chart for Most Common Complaints here.

By analyzing words in negative reviews, we identify recurring themes. These themes highlight areas where British Airways might need to focus its efforts.

This project extensively uses matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization. These graphs help:

Quickly grasp the overall sentiment of reviews.
Recognize areas of excellence and potential improvement.
Understand trends in customer satisfaction based on routes and service categories.
